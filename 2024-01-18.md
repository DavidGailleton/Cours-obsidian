Dear Mister blanchett,

Firstly, I hope everythings is alright in your life and I want to thank you a lot to think about me for this job.

Unfortunetly I'm not interested in an fixed-term contract for this time. However, if a permanant contract is possible I could think about it.

Kind regards,
David
