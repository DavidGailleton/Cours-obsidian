The European Commission showed ambition and flexibility at the United Nations COP27 climate change conference in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 15Â°C. After a week of negotiations, a strong and united European effort helped seal a deal to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement alive. The parties agree on the need for rapid deep and sustainable reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. They also recognized the importance of accelerated action in this critical decade and agreed to rollover nationally determined investments to align with the Paris Agreement by the end of 2023. The parties also agreed to create new financial mechanisms to help developing countries development vulnerable to negative impacts. Finally, President van der Leyen participated in several partnerships and initiated cooperation on forestry and climate with various countries.
